The purpose of this little script is to reduce the time needed to configure a web domain with Nginx.

First, you'll need to add  the newDomain Folder to your server running Nginx.
It doesn't need to be a specific folder as long as the script can run bash.
I installed it at /etc/newDomain

Once you have the script in place, we need to run the following code:

sudo ./new.sh mydomain.com
This will execute new.sh and will create the configuration needed for mydomain.com.

You can open new.sh and see all it does, but basically what the script does is:

*Copies "template" to /sites-available/template
*Edits the config of template for your domain
*Creates a symbolic link between /sites-available/template and /sites-enabled/template
*Creates directories in the /www/ folder of nginx
*Copies index.html to the final folder of your website
*Reloads Nginx

If everything went ok, you should see your website working.


The cool thing about this script is that is flexible. you can configurate the nginx template, 
the files you'd like to be created when a new website is created or even what you want the script itself
to do.

I strongly advise you to try it before using it for production projects since It hasn't been tested thoughtfully.
